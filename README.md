# Escape from `/dev/null`
## Google Stockholm - 2013-04-20

This is our (@vals, @brainstorm) repository for the 'Escape from `/dev/null`' competition at Google Stockholm.

The text for the challanges we made it to can be viewed, along with some challange specific experimentation
can be found in this IPython notebook:

Most of the code implemented is in the file `devnull_srv.py`.
